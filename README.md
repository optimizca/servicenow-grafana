# FAQ

### I just updated to v1.3.0 and everything is broken. How do I fix it?

Version 1.3.0 includes a change to the plugin id and name, meaning Grafana does not recognize them as the same. To get back up and running please follow the steps below:

- Navigate to the datasource configuration tab inside your Grafana instance and delete the old version of the datasource
- [Follow these steps to re-configure the updated datasource](#step-3-grafana-datasource-configuration)
- Delete and re-import all included dashboards so that they work with the updated datasource

### How do I fix the "Panel plugin not found: x" error?

You are seeing this because the panel plugin we used in the dashboard is not installed on your instance of Grafana.

- Take note of the panel plugin name displayed in the error (plugin names are formatted like (author)-(pluginName)-(pluginType))
  ![Missing Plugin Error](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/missing_plugin_error.png)
- Navigate to Grafana Configuration => Plugins
- Search for the plugin in the error (Search based on the middle word the plugin displayed in the error)
  ![Search Missing Plugin](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_for_plugin.png)
- Click into the plugin (You will know its the correct one based off the authors name)
- Click the Install Button
  ![Install Plugin Button](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/install_plugin.png)

### Why am I getting a Bad Gateway error on my panels?

The default timeout for requests made by Grafana in 30 seconds. If your request takes longer than 30 seconds you will see this error.

There are a few possible fixes for this error. Please try each fix as they all work differently and will depend on your needs of the data.

- If you are looking for a subset of data rather than the entire table, try adding some filters to the Sysparam Query
- If displaying every field on the record is not a necessity, try specifying which fields you would like to see in the Table Columns option
- If your familiar with pagination we also have this as an option to reduce the amount of records returned in each query. To use pagination, in the Limit option enter in the number of records to return per request(default is 9999). Then increment the Page option by 1 each time you wish to advance pages(default starts at 0)
- The last fix here is one I do not recommend but is still an option. In the data source configuration page there is an option called Timeout, there you can specify your desired request timeout in seconds(default is 30). I do not recommend this fix as it will likely lead you to the error below this one, use at your own risk.

### How do I fix the error "String object would exceed maximum permitted size of 33554432"?

This happens when the amount of data being returned from a query is greater than 32MB.

- To fix this issue, try the steps in the above question as both are fixed in nearly the same way.

### How do I fix the error Bad Request "Requested URI does not represent any resource"?

We do not currently know what causes this issue as it happens on some instances but not others. If you have more information, please let us know :)

- Inside of your ServiceNow instance, search for and click on "Scripted REST APIs"
  ![Search for Scripted REST APIs](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_rest_apis.png)
- Search the Name field for "Grafana API" and open the record
  ![Search name Grafana API](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/search_grafana_api.png)
- Remove the "Scripted REST External Default" ACL from the list and save the record
  ![ACL Option](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix1.png)
  ![Removing ACL from list](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix2.png)
- In the same record, add the "Scripted REST External Default" ACL back into the list and save the record again
  ![Add ACL back into list](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/acl_fix3.png)

### Why do the select boxes show "No options found"?

Currently you will see this on nearly every select box, but we plan to improve/fix this in a future update.

- To get past the "No options found" message, simply enter a space or start typing your desired option and the options will be updated to show actual values

### How do I change the icons in the Topology(Service Dependency Graph) panel?

Icons are based on CI Class and use RegEx.

- Clicking on a node in the Topology panel will display that CI's Class.
  - (Node labeled **_Starting Point_** will **NOT** display a class)
    ![Topology on-click CI Class](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/click_on_topology_node.png)
- In the panel options, go to the section called Icon Mapping. At the bottom of this section, click the Add Icon Mapping button.
  - (**IGNORE** the section called **_External Icon Mapping_**)
    ![Icon Mapping Section](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/icon_mapping_section.png)
- Copy & paste or create a RegEx that matches the CI Class you saw in step 1.
  ![Icon Mapping RegEx](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/icon_mapping_regex.png)
- Then select an icon which will be mapped to all CI's whose Class matches your RegEx.
  ![Icon Selection](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/select_icon.png)

### How do I fix blank Topology panel icons?

When changing data in the Topology panel, the icons will not load dynamically. ![Topology Panel Blank Icons](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/topology_icons_blank.png)

To fix the icons without reloading the entire page, follow the steps below.

- Click on the Refresh(üóò) symbol inside the panel. This will fix the icons, but your layout won't look right
  ![Topology Panel Refresh Button](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/topology_refresh_button.png)
- Click on the Tree structure symbol to fix the layout.
  ![Topology Panel Layout Button](https://github.com/optimizca/servicenow-grafana/raw/main/readme_images/topology_layout_button.png)

If you still see blank icons please double check your Icon Mapping RegEx to ensure it matches the CI Class of the node you are looking at. [Click here to learn about creating an icon mapping](#how-do-i-change-the-icons-in-the-topologyservice-dependancy-graph-panel)

Also note that the "Starting Point" node shows a blank icon by default. This can be changed by adding an Icon Mapping entry with blank RegEx and your desired icon.

# Query Editor Options

The plugin supports a wide variety of "Query Categories" allowing you to query data in different ways or perform special processing on the data. Each Query Category will provide you with different options to fill out in order to get the data your looking for.

## Query Categories

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Alerts](#alerts)
- [Changes](#changes)
- [Topology](#topology)
- [Live Agent Data](#live-agent-data)
- [Table](#table)
- [Row Count](#row-count)
- [Aggregate](#aggregate)
- [GeoHash Map](#geohash-map)
- [Log Data](#log-data)
- [Trend Data](#trend-data)
- [Outage Status](#outage-status)
- [Anomaly](#anomaly)

### Metrics

Used to gather time-series metric data from CI's.

| Option Name | Description | Options | Additional Info |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Service | Selecting a service will filter the CI options below to only CIs in that service | All Services | No effect on final query |
| CI | Select CI(s) which you would like to retrieve metrics for. This will also filter the Resource ID and Metric Name options below so they are relevant to the CI(s) chosen | All CI's or CI's in selected service | |
| Resource ID | Select the resource you wish to collect metrics from | All Resources in the selected CI(s), and \* | Use the \* to get all resources |
| Metric Name | Select the metrics you wish to retrieve | All metrics in the selected CI(s), and \* | Use the \* to get all resources |
| Anomaly | (True) Gather RAW, MIN, MAX & AVG of each metric. (False) Gather only the RAW data | [True, False] | |
| Sysparam Query | This is used to filter your results down using the same syntax as filtering a table in ServiceNow | | (Advanced variant) |

### Alerts

Used to gather Alerts(em_alert) along with some additional processing to determine impacted services, parse TBAC tags out of additional_info and more.

| Option Name | Description | Options | Additional Info |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Service | Selecting a service will filter the CI options below to only CIs in that service. May also be used to query any Alerts affecting selected service | All Services |  |
| CI | Selecting CI(s) will filter results down to only Alerts with those CI(s) | All CI's or CI's in selected service | |
| Alert Type Filter | This option determines if you would like to base your query on the Service or CI selected. If not, select None to ignore the Service and CI fields then filter using other options | [CI, Service, None] | |
| Alert State Filter | Filters Alert records by state. Select Active to return Open or Reopen records and All to return records with any state | [Active, All] | |
| Sysparam Query | This is used to filter your results down using the same syntax as filtering a table in ServiceNow | | (Advanced variant) |
| Tag Keys & Tag Values | Selecting one or multiple keys and values will filter results down to records where additional info matches the Tags selected | Records that match the other filters will be queries for their additional info. The additional info is then parsed out to expose only tags which use the tag normalization. AKA additional info keys which contain a prefix of 'tbac-' | |
| Limit | Limits the amount of records returned to the number submitted | 1-9999 | Default is 9999 |
| Page | This option in combination with the Limit can be thought of as pagination for your requests. Ex. Setting a limit of 10 returns the first 10 records and to see the 10 records following those, increase your page number. | 0-9999 | Default is 0, which is the first page |
| Grafana Timerange | Toggle on and select a table column that contains a time. This will filter results to find records where the chosen table column is BETWEEN the time range set in Grafana. | [On, Off], Table Column | Grafana time range is found in the top right of any dashboard |

### Changes

Used to query the Changes(change_request) table.

| Option Name | Description | Options | Additional Info |

| CI | Selecting CI(s) will filter results down to only Changes with those CI(s) | All CI's or CI's in selected service | |
| Change Type Filter | This option determines if you would like to base your query on the Service or CI selected. If not, select None to ignore the Service and CI fields then filter using other options | [Service, CI, None] | |
| Sysparam Query | This is used to filter your results down using the same syntax as filtering a table in ServiceNow | | (Advanced variant) |
| Limit | Limits the amount of records returned to the number submitted | 1-9999 | Default is 9999 |
| Page | This option in combination with the Limit can be thought of as pagination for your requests. Ex. Setting a limit of 10 returns the first 10 records and to see the 10 records following those, increase your page number. | 0-9999 | Default is 0, which is the first page |
| Grafana Timerange | Toggle on and select a table column that contains a time. This will filter results to find records where the chosen table column is BETWEEN the time range set in Grafana. | [On, Off], Table Column | Grafana time range is found in the top right of any dashboard |

### Topology

Used to recreate service mapping/topology diagrams. Must be used in combination with our included version of the Service Dependency Graph(forked from novatec-sdg-panel) panel plugin.

| Option Name | Description | Options | Additional Info |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Starting Point | Select a CI to start the topology diagram from | All CI's | This field is mandatory |
| Parent Depth | Determines the number of levels to search **up** the tree of dependencies | 0-10 | Recommended to keep below 5 for performance |
| Child Depth | Determines the number of levels to search **down** the tree of dependencies | 0-10 | Recommended to keep below 5 for performance |
| Sysparam Query | This is used to filter your results down using the same syntax as filtering a table in ServiceNow | | (Advanced variant) |

### Live Agent Data

| Table Name | Select the table you wish to query data from | All tables in the sys_db_object table | Any table or database view that does not appear as an option can be inserted as a custom value |
| Table Columns | Select the columns you wish to query on the chosen table. If none are selected, all columns will be returned | All columns for the selected table in the sys_dictionary | Any column that does not appear as an option can be inserted as a custom value |
| Sysparam Query | This is used to filter your results down using the same syntax as filtering a table in ServiceNow | | (Basic variant) |
| Sort By | Select a table column to sort your records on, then choose if the sort is Ascending(ASC) or Descending(DESC) | All columns for the selected table in the sys_dictionary, [ASC, DESC] | Any column that does not appear as an option can be inserted as a custom value |
| Limit | Limits the amount of records returned to the number submitted | 1-9999 | Default is 9999 |
| Page | This option in combination with the Limit can be thought of as pagination for your requests. Ex. Setting a limit of 10 returns the first 10 records and to see the 10 records following those, increase your page number. | 0-9999 | Default is 0, which is the first page |
